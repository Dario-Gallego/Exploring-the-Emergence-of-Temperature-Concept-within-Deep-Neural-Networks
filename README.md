# Exploring the Emergence of Temperature Concept within Deep Neural Networks through Next-Frame Image Prediction
Several experiments exploring the Emergence of Temperature Concept within Deep Neural Networks through Next-Frame Image Prediction by using Keras (TensorFlow)

This repository is a collection of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks intended to train models to see if the temperature concept can emerge inside the neural network.

The whole code is the result of a final Master's Thesis of the [Master's Degree in Fundamental Principles of Data Science](https://mat.ub.edu/sciencedata/) supervised by Oriol Pujol and Jordi Vitri√†.

The notebooks have been written and tested on Python 3.10 and Keras (3.3.3) and the data generation uses [PyBullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) library.
